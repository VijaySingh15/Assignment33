            Relaxing nature sounds for sleeping, is something that has been
            tested in study after study. Repeated research, studying sounds of
            nature as a sleep aid has been carried out in institutions
            throughout the world. Nature sounds have been proven to be calm and
            relaxing to both mind and body.
