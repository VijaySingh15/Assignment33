<!--8. Suppose, you have published some code on GitHub, and you have to create a proper documentation web page for that.
     ( Learn more about code documentation here ) Things, you have to keep in mind:
    Give proper instructions to user about how to use your code.
    Use proper emojis, ( avoid images ) to keep clarity.
    Clearly mention, about feedback and support you will be giving to user, if he/she faces problem with your code.-->

                What's Up everyone. Today I am going to discuss Git and Github . So
                today i am going to talk about what is Git?, Why is it around? and
                What is Github?. So Let’s get started.<br />
                <b>Git:</b> So Git is a version control system. Let’s assume I have
                made an AI desktop assistant. Now I was working on version 1 which
                has 3 files, f1, f2, and data.csv. After a few days I have changed
                the code and made version 3 which also has 3 files, but this time
                f1, f2 file doesn't exist, instead it has f3, f4 and data.csv. So
                now f1, f2 files are not around.If in the future we get into a
                situation where we need those files there will be no option, but if
                we use a version control system like Git then we can go back and see
                those files and work with it.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>How was Git Started:</b> In 2002 the programmers who were working
                for development of Linux started using Bitkeeper VCS as their
                version control system. But in 2005 Bitkeeper removed their free of
                charge status from them and asked to pay the Linux Development team
                a huge amount of money. After this Linus Torvalds, the creator of
                Linux started making his own version control system and then he made
                Git, a free Centralised Version Control System. And everyone started
                using Git.
